# Clustering_Models

### Clustering is the process of grouping objects with similar objects. For example, in the image below we have a collection of 2D coordinates that have been clustered into three categories - top left (yellow), bottom (red), and top right (blue).

A major difference between clustering and classification models is that clustering is an ‘unsupervised’ method, where ‘training’ is done without labels. Instead, models identify examples that have a similar collection of features. In the image above, examples that are in a similar location are grouped together.

Clustering is common and useful for exploring new data where patterns between data points, such as high-level categories, are not yet known. It's used in many fields that need to automatically label complex data, including analysis of social networks, brain connectivity, spam filtering, and so on.

By using the provided notebook, you will gain a deeper understanding of clustering models.
